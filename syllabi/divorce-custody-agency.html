          <p class="desc-syllabus desc-syllabus-start">After many years of association and inter-disciplinary collaboration, at Jose Sert's 1953 Urban Design conference, the disciplines of architecture and urban planning divorced. As usual, irreconcilable differences were cited, largely having to do with one accusing the other of (design) incompetence and the other accusing the one of excessive navel gazing. A lengthy custody battle then ensued over urban design. Split custody was not an option; instead, each discipline claimed custody when it was easiest and most beneficial for itself. But now, 50 years later, urban design is grown up and its own entity. What does this developmental milestone mean for the newly adult discipline and its former custodians?</p>
          <p class="desc-syllabus desc-syllabus-end">This course will explore the theoretical location of urban design, whether it is its own discipline and subject matter, or merely a brand to be invoked by other professions when it benefits them. Coursework consists of readings, mappings, court filings, and unhappy unions.</p>
