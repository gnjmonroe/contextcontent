          <p class="q-prompt">What is urban design?</p>
          <p class="q-response-one"><i>(laughs)</i> What is <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span>? <b>I mean, you guys have heard me say my spiel in general, which is that I don’t think that <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span> is a discipline in and of itself. <span class="caption-highlight">I think it’s a kind of interdisciplinary design concentration that’s something that architects do. No offense to either of you</span>, neither of you are architects, but I think it’s a scale of design that can be engaged by architects, landscape architects, planners, but it’s not a fundamentally different discipline.</b> It’s a scale and venue for design that demands that in a different way. And, in a greater intensity, demands that designers engage issues of politics and economics and society, because it kind of brings those things more to the fore. But I don’t think, I don’t think that <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span> is a is a discipline of its own. I think it’s a it’s a scale of design that forces or for which it behooves the designer to engage these other kinds of exigencies around a given <span class="keyword-highlight">context</span>.</p>

        <div class="q-container">
          <p class="q-prompt">What makes your work urban?</p>
          <p class="q-response-one">Yeah, I don’t know. You guys have probably heard me talk about this before too. <span class="caption-highlight">The way I was educated as an architect, there is really no difference.</span> <b>Like, I was educated, I think from the beginning as a formalist and <span class="keyword-highlight">contextualist</span>. And when I was learning about architecture at, like, the age of 18, there was no distinction between drawing, designing, and understanding the city and drawing, designing, and understanding the building. So like, those kinds of questions are almost foreign to me. Like the <span class="keyword-highlight">urban</span> is one scale of gathering the concerns around design and architecture is another scale of gathering concerns around design, but they’re not fundamentally different.</b> So, yeah, I guess like I think being <span class="keyword-highlight">urban</span> does have something to do with being, for me at least, with being a <span class="keyword-highlight">contextualist</span> with like wanting to understand the, the various and sometimes conflicting, demands that go on in any project or the kind of ideas or constituencies that gather around the project. Like even if you’re doing a house, I think there’s like an <span class="keyword-highlight">urbanism</span> to that kind of that model of thinking. I guess that’s what makes me think my work is <span class="keyword-highlight">urban</span>. But I never, like, I didn’t do, teach <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span> or anything like that until I came here. And people like Maria are like, “oh, you’re doing <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span>.” I didn’t even know what <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span> is. The easy answer to the question is like it concerns the city <i>(laughs)</i> or concerns urbanization. Like something beyond the building object. Although I guess I just just contradicted that by saying, like, there can be an internal urbanism to the building object.

        <div class="q-container">
          <p class="q-prompt">Who is doing compelling work in urban design right now?</p>
          <p class="q-response-start">Yeah, I saw that question. It’s a hard one to answer. <b>I mean, I like Interboro’s work a lot. I think they’re doing interesting <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span> work. I like people, as you know, like Nicholas de Moncheaux, who’s not necessarily doing a lot of like, built work. I think that there are other good offices that are now doing pretty good <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span> like Studio Gang now, I think.</b></p>
          <p class="q-response-mid"><b>I think that the amount of capital required for <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design projects</span> almost necessarily bends the model towards the decoration of the neoliberal city which is a, it’s something it’s like a proficiency and ability, like, to do things like what James Corner does, for example. It’s something that I can certainly appreciate. But it’s also not something I want to fully endorse, especially now that we can fully recognize what projects like The High Line actually do to issues of equity and access and stuff like that.</b></p>
          <p class="q-response-mid"><b>So, other people I like? I like Tim Love, Utile, just because it’s kind of like a realpolitik approach like really engaging the political economy of the city. Who else? I mean, Weiss/Manfredi is already doing perfectly good work.</b></p>
          <p class="q-response-end">At one point I was going to turn my career towards this question, and then I decided it was too hard. <b>But <span class="caption-highlight">I don’t think that there’s a compelling, progressive aesthetic project, in <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span></span>. And that’s what that’s what it would take for me to really get fully invested or fully behind a practice.</b> I think that we have practices that do not take the aesthetic project, particularly seriously. Like there’s no, there sometimes is not a lot of conviction, like maybe the most intellectually interesting <span class="keyword-highlight">urban designers</span> like even like Kate Orff or Nicholas de Moncheaux, like these people I find really really interesting I think they don’t believe in or invest in an aesthetic project, on one hand and the kind of progressive aspects of their practice are often about the, you know, like systems or computation or whatever it might be. So that’s on one hand, like these are the progressives and the people who seem most interested in aesthetics are regressive. It’s like the <span class="keyword-highlight">new urbanists</span> and like those kinds of people, but I don’t see if I feel like there’s a space up there for yet somebody who wants to have like a conviction about an aesthetic project for <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span>, the contemporary city and progressive aesthetic project, I don’t know what that would be.</p>

          <p class="q-prompt">What do you try to teach urban design students?</p>
          <p class="q-response-one"><bold>Critical thinking?</bold> I don’t know. What else do I like to teach <span class="keyword-highlight">urban designers?</span> <b>I like to get people out of their comfort zone, to rethink their received assumptions, to think critically. I like to get them and kind of invested in aesthetics. <span class="caption-highlight">I like to get <span class="keyword-highlight">urban designers</span> also to think about the relationship between former aesthetics and politics and society. Try to stir, stir all of that up.</span> I think I’m better at teaching students to do those things to kind of be critical of received assumptions and to kind of push their comfort zone.</b> I think I’m better at that. As an instructor than I am ushering students through like detailed realizations of projects. I think that that’s there are other people that are better at that than me. That’s why I like I liked it last year when I had you guys first I could just, just shake, and shake it up. A hive of hornets. <i>(laughs)</i></p>

          <p class="q-response-one">What is a common misconception of <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span>? <b>For me, a common misconception of <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span> is that it’s altogether different than what we do as architects or landscape architects, that like consideration of the city is like a completely different skill set.</b> <span class="caption-highlight">I think it’s a re-articulation, kind of like these things that we do as designers.</span></p>

          <p class="q-prompt">Where do you think urban design is heading?</p>
          <p class="q-response-one"><b>I mean, the inevitable direction, whether it’s where <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span> is headed, like, the project of articulating <span class="keyword-highlight">urban futures</span> seems inevitably headed towards computation, like increasing methods of computation. Probably engaging professionals who are non-standard designers.</b> I think that puts <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span> in an interesting problematic, like, does the sub-discipline want to embrace that? Does it want to be a staunch pillar of resistance and in service of some other higher principles? Or does it want to find an intermediary place? I mean, I think I would be the third of those just because I’m circumspect and dialectical by nature. But I’m not, I’m not sure. <span class="caption-highlight">I guess like for <span class="keyword-highlight">urban design</span> to exist, like <span class="keyword-highlight">urban designers</span> have to care because nobody else gives a shit. Like there’s no problem with things going on, like, as status quo without <span class="keyword-highlight">urban designers</span></span>. <b>That’s not a, it’s not an issue at all. So yeah, I think it’s a problem for you guys. Again, like a problem and in a good sense, like, not a bad problem.</b></p>
