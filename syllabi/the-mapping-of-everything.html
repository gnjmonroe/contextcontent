          <p class="desc-syllabus desc-syllabus-one">With the widespread availability of urban geolocated data, open and closed, so to say, the role of spatial analysis finds itself in a moment of critical importance. This course is about capitalizing on this moment by reviewing current best practices and discovering new possibilities for mapping and spatial analysis, primarily through GIS. In this course, students will map literally everything: transit, plot lines, diversity, culture, niche interests, postboxes, dog turds. Each week students will produce new maps of urban data and overlay these maps to image new information and insights at the intersections of data. By overlaying more and more data, students will find increasingly complex and illuminating results, ultimately leading towards objective truth. The final project will have each student producing their own tortured venn diagram of geolocated data and sharing their insights with the class and an invited panel of accomplished spatial analysts.</p>
